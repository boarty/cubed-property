      <h2>Hello from us all at Cubed Property</h2>
      <p>Cubed Property was started by an NTU business school graduate who decided to buy a house in his final year and rent the rooms out to his mates. After graduating instead of applying for grad schemes he decided to put his entrepreneurship degree to use and start a property company instead.</p>
      <p>15 years later, Cubed Property has grown to operate a couple of dozen properties which we own, lease and manage for ourselves and a few other stakeholders. We're not a massive corporate organisation and try to work more like a Landlord who looks after their own properties with a personal touch. That said, given the various business pursuits that the management team have been involved in over that period, we have a whole host of experience in the property investment, development and management landscape.</p>
      <p>Most of our properties are student focused however we do operate a few professional houseshares and single lets too which people often move into after they graduate if they plan on staying in Nottingham.</p>

      <h2>In house team</h2>
      <p>Majority of the time if you call or email the office it will be our Property Manager Ellie who will be helping you out. After nearly 10 years of working across various backgrounds in Property Lettings, Ellie joined CP in 2020 as our Superstar Property Manager and now now runs majority of Cubed Property's day to day operations. Ellie is always always tweaking and improving things so if you have any suggestions please don't be shy to say hello and let us know.</p>
      <p>Rich has run Cubed's accounts and admin requirement in various capacities since 2013. He is our IT, admin and bookkeeping wizard and helps keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes. He uses the excuse of cycling to indulge in his love of lycra and when not pedaling his way round Nottingham enjoys nothing more than a 15 hour long movie session with beers and pizza.</p>
